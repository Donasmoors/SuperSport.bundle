SuperSport.bundle
=================

SuperSport video plugin for Plex

Information:
============

This plug in will allow you to watch live sports streams and highlighs packages from the SuperSport website.

In order to watch live streams you must enter your login details that are linked to your smartcard.

Enjoy!

Known Issues:
=============

- Live streams will not work if they are transcoded by the server. This means that live streams will not work on basically all mobile devices.
- None of the streams play on the Plex\Web application. This is not due to the plugin but rather the incomplete nature of the development on that project.

There are probably a few more issues that haven't been found yet due to fact that I can't test this on all Plex compatible devices. If you find errors, please create an issue so I can take a look if it can be resolved.


Instructions:
=============

1. To add this plugin to Plex copy this .bundle folder to your PlexMediaServer plug-ins folder.
2. Make sure you have set "Disable capability checking" in the PlexMediaServer setting under the Channels submenu.
3. To ensure proper operation restart PlexMediaServer after initially installing this plugin.

This plugin is a port from the original SuperSport plugin for XBMC written and maintained by Bounce and Tinuva.
